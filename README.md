# Discord Fashion Bot

This is the codebase for a Discord bot that is meant to respond to user's requests to display runways dependent on designer and collections. The bot parses Vogue 
runway collections in order to grab and post the images.

# Motivation

I made this bot without the intention of using it as a serious bot - I wanted to learn the ropes to BeautifulSoup/requests APIs, as well as AWS backend support
and then transfer this knowledge to other similar projects and create other interactive bots that communities on Discord could use, but Vogue was definitely a 
website that I was looking at to start because of its easily structured website.

# Future Work

In the future I intend to expand upon this bot by adding more interactive features. 
- A rating system that allows people to use reactions to rate each outfit and then after a predetermined timer redisplays a comprehensive list of the highest rated photos.
